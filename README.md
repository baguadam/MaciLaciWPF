# About
This repository contains the implementation of the programming project for C# and .NET Course of Eötvös Lorand Unisersity's Computer Science Bsc. The main task was to implement a grid-based WPF application. This is a so-called "Maci-Laci" game in which the user is playing with a bear character, has to step on the board and collect the baskets, while different numbers of cops are chasing the character and there are several trees to block the route of the player. The main task was to use event-handling and implement the game using **MVVM-architecture**.

# Structure of the game

The game is structured based on the MVVM-architecture's pattern.
